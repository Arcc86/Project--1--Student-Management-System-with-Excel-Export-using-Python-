This project is a simple and practical Student Management System built using Python. It includes a graphical interface made with Tkinter, a command-line version, and Excel integration for data storage.
Although the interface is in Spanish, I am fully bilingual, so language is not a limitation for developing or understanding software in English or Spanish.
