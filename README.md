The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the early stages of my Python learning journey by creating a functional Student Management System specifically designed for a reading club. I developed this application to help organize student participation, record their information more efficiently, and simplify the process of exporting data to Excel for tracking and administration.
Through this project, I aimed to apply and strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, GUI development with Tkinter, and file handling techniques. It also serves as one of my first real-world applications, combining what I have learned so far into a practical tool with a real purpose. I currently work in both English and Spanish, which is why you may see some parts of the project in Spanish, but this is not a problem for me.
